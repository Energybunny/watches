				<h1>Watch Movements</h1>
				<p id="textboxintro">
					The part of the watch that makes it tick is called a movement. There are several different types of movements that are good for different purposes. In this article I will go over a few of these different types and discuss the different usages for them.  
				</p>

				<b>Mechanical</b>
				<p>
					A mechanical movement is the traditional way of keeping time. This type of clockwork has been used for a few hundred years and has become perfected over time. They are generally not quite as accurate or reliable as their competitiors. Mechanical movements genereally have a higher beat than quartz ones which is why a lot of people prefer them. <br>
					They are driven by a wound up main spring that releases the tension a little it at a time. This spring makes the balance wheel oscillate which in turn makes the hands tick. This is a very general explanation since I'm not very knowledgable about movements.

				<b>Automatic</b>
				<p>
					An automatic movement is basically a mechanical movement that can also be wound up by the movement of your wrist. There is a small rotor that spins as your wrist moves around. When this rotor spins, it winds the main spring. Some automatic movements also have the ability to be hand-wound but this is generally seen in watches above 300€. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Quartz</b>
				<p>
					A quartz watch is your run of the mill battery powered watch. The battery in the watch runs an electric current through a quartz crystal. As this happens, the crystal starts to vibrate. This vibration can be harnessed and in turn used to drive a movement. These types of movements are almost always more accurate than their mechanical counterparts as well as being more affordable.

				<b>Solar</b>
				<p>
					Solar watches are just what they sound like. They are quartz watches equipped with solar cells, usually underneath the dial, that charge the watch. I personally prefer these types of movements to normal quartz ones since it eliminates the need for a battery change.
