				<h1>Watches under 500€</h1>
				<p id="textboxintro">
					There are a lot of good watches at this price point out there, but there are also a lot of garbage. In this article I'm going to show you a few good pieces for under 500€ that offer great value for money. 
				</p>

				<b>Tissot Visodate</b>
				<p>
					The Tissot Visodate is a very popular time piece today and this is most likely not the last time you will hear of it. The watch is part of their heritage line that takes inspiration from some of their older models released during the 1900s. This particular one is very similar to an older visodate from the mid-century. The main difference between them is the size. <br>
					This watch houses and ETA-2836 which, if you are familiar with ETA movements, contains a day/date complication. I would recommend the white dial as the contrasting day/date wheel juts looks quite off to me. Overall, this is a great piece.

				<b>Seiko sarb033/035</b>
				<p>
					What can be said about these watches that hasn't been said a thousand times already. These JDM models from Seiko Japan offer an insane value for the cost. They have started to go up in price since being discontinued but are still worth it in my opinion.<br>
					These watches contain the very famous 6r15 movement that can nowadays be seen in more expensive Seiko Presage watches. This movement is a standardd 3-hander with a date wheel, hand-winding and hacking. It is basically a modified and improved version of the world renowned 7s26.

				<b>Orient Bambino</b>
				<p>
					This watch is considered by most to be one of the best value watches under 200€, and for good reason. Firstly, there are a lot of different version of this watch with different dials, faces and cases. There are also 2 generations. The difference here is the movement as the 2nd one hacks and hand-winds while the first one does not. Recently they have also released a small seconds and an open heart version of the watch which is very nice to see.
