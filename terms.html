				<h1>Watch Terms</h1>
				
				
				<hr>
				<b>Case</b>
				<p>
					The case of a watch is exactly what it sound like, it's the whole metal casing which contains the movement and the rest of the watch parts. The case is generally round but can of course be other shapes as well. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Dial</b>
				<p>
					The dial is basically the base plate for the face of the watch. If you say that the watch has a white face, you really mean that it has a white dial. The face of the watch consits of the dial, hands, markers and all of the complications on the watch. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Hands</b>
				<p>
					The hands are located at the center of the watch face and are used to tell time. Most watches have a minute, hour and second hand. Certain watches with more complications, like a chronograph or gmt, add another hand or change the function of an already existing one. In the case of the chronograph, the second has been replaced by a stop watch hand. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Bezel</b>
				<p>
					The bezel is the metal part that goes around the watch face. In most cases the bezel is just a piece of polished or brushed metal but in some cases they replace it with something else. Dive watches, for an example, usually have a ceramic bezel with extra markings that can be rotated to easily record time. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Lugs</b>
				<p>
					The lugs are the parts of the case that stick out and attach to the strap or bracelet. The strap or bracelet usually attach to the lugs via so called spring bars. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Measurements</b>
				<p>
					When measuring a watch there are a lot of different dimensions to take into account. The diameter of the watch is the most important one and it's basically just the width of the case. The second most important one is thickness (self explanatory). Then you have lug width and lug to lug distance. The lug width is the distance between the two lugs on the same side of the watch. This determines the size of strap you will use. The lug to lug distance is the measurement from the end of the lugs on one side to end of the ones on the other side of the case. This one is quite significant for people with smaller wrists as lugs that stick out over the sides of your wrists will look strange and oversized. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Complications</b>
				<p>
					A complication is basically another function the watch has. The most common ones are probably date windows and chronographs. If you want a more in depth look at what different complications there are and what they're used for, check out my article <a href="complications.html" class="ref">here</a>. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Movement</b>
				<p>
					The movement of a watch is like the engine of a car, it's what makes it tick. There are several different movements with pros and cons alike. The two main types of movements are quartz and mechanical. A quartz movement is an electrical movement that used the vibrations of a quartz crystal to measure the time. These types of movement are generally very accurate and affordable, but also a bit boring in the eyes of an enthusiast. Mechanical movements use gears and springs to keep the time. These movements use quite old and outdated technology and are therefor not quite as accurate as quartz. The main attraction to these types of movements is the craftsmanship behind it. While quartz watches are objectively better, mechanical ones are more interesting. To read more about different types of movement, read my article <a href="movements.html" class="ref">here</a>. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Crown</b>
				<p>
					The crown is the small circular part that stick out from the side of the watch. The crown is used to wind mechanical watches and to set the time and date of the watch. A crown can be screwed down, which means you have to screw it up before used. This is generally seen as a very good feature of a watch since it increases it water resistance and strengthens the crown itself. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Pushers</b>
				<p>
					Pushers are small buttons that can be found on watches with certain complications. The most common usage of pushers is with chronographs. You press one of the pushers to start and stop the chronograph and use the second one to reset it. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Indicies and numerals</b>
				<p>
					These are the parts of the watch face that indicate hours, minutes and seconds. These can be simple square markers, arabic numerals, roman numerals or one of many more styles. These are always of a contrasting color to the dial itself. In a lot of cases they are applied, which means they are glued on to the dial to make them stand out more. This is generally considered a more premium feature than normal painted ones. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Lume</b>
				<p>	
					Lume, short for luminescence, is a substance applied to parts of the dial to make them glow in the dark. It is generally only used on sports watches since it's not considered very elegant. Lume is most commonly applied to the hands and indicies but in some cases the entire dial has a layer of lume on it.
