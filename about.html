					<b>Who am I?</b>
					<p>
						My name is Daniel Wilsson (DW) and I come from Stockholm, Sweden. At the moment,
						I am located in the most southern part of sweden in a town called Trelleborg. I
						attend upper secodary school win Ystad. I have been doing webdesign since August 2018
						and have been interested in watches since 2017. My current watch collection only
						consists of two watches; a Seiko sarb033 and a Citizen Eco-Drive AT2141-87E.

					<b>Why did I create this website?</b>
					<p>
						This website started out as a school project and originally covered completely
						different subject. The idea was to make a website and fill it with content that
						I had alreadyu written before, in this case it was about PC components. I then felt
						that the site I had created was insuffcient for my own satisfaction so I decided
						to remake it. In order for me to have motivation, I made it about a subject I have
						a genuin interest in. Watches. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As the project continued I developed the website more and more. Eventually it
						reached a state where I felt I couldn't improve it more with my current skills. 
						At this point I started filling it with content, such as text and images.
