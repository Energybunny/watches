				<h1>Watches under 1000€</h1>
				<p id="textboxintro">
					There are a lot of good watches at this price point out there, but there are also a lot of garbage. In this article I'm going to show you a few good pieces for under 1000€ that offer great value for money.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Junghans Max Bill</b>
				<p>
					The Junghans Max Bill is a true legend. In the 50s, Junghans had cooperation with the Swiss architect, designer and artist Max Bill. Together they created a truly iconic line of watches that has had massive influence on the watches released today. While they were not very popular at the time, people have grown to love them. <br>
					This watch houses an ETA-2824 movement which is very good. Not only is it accurate, but it has a beat of 28 800 bph.  
				</p>

				<b>Baltic Bicompax 001</b>
				<p>
					This piece might not be quite as iconic as the Junghans but it is in my opinion equally as good looking. It draws inspiration from chronographs of the 40s and 50s while still having something modern about it. <br> 
					The movement inside is a Sea Gull st-1901 column wheel movement. It might be Chinese, but it is definitely not bad quality. 
				</p>

				<b>Hamilton Intra-Matic</b>
				<p>
					Since Hamilton now belongs to the Swatch Group it is considered a Swiss brand, although this hasn't always been the case. Back in the day Hamilton was an American brand that supplied watches to the US military. <br>
					You can really see the American heritage when looking at this watch, which is something taht really speaks to me. It houses the ETA-2892-2, that can often be found in much more expensive pieces.
