			When talking about watches the term "complications" might come up, 
			but what does it mean?
			A complication is basically another function that's been added to the 
			watch and made the manufacturing process more "complicated". <br>
			The picture above shows a pilots watch from the swiss watch brand IWC. 
			This watch has 3 complications, a chronograph, a date window and a day 
			window. Read more about different types of complications

			Quartz, mechanical, automatic, solar, mecha-quartz? What do these words 
			even mean? They are different types of watch movements, eg different ways
			of making a watch "tick". The most common one in watches today is quartz,
			a battery powered movement. Quartz is most often seen in more affordable
			watches and when you look at more expensive models, they are usually
			mechanical. A mechanical movement is driven by a main spring that's been
			wound up either by hand or by the movement of your wrist during the day.
			Solar, automatic and mecha-quartz are different types of mechanical and 
			quartz movements.<br> Read more about what makes your watch tick

			Choosing which watch to buy a very difficult thing. There are a ton of 
			different types of watches for a ton of different price points. I have 
			a few points I like to look at when choosing a watch to buy; finishing,
			movement, case shape, dial and hands. I also like to think about how the
			watch will work for my everyday life. Will it be elegant enough to fit my
			outifts and will it be strong enough to take a hit? Click
