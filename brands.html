				<h1>Brands</h1>
				<p id="textboxintro">
				There are a lot of good and bad brands on today's market. Some old that have existed for over 100 years and some new that started this very year. In this article I'm going to talk about some of my favourite brands on the market that offer great value for the money. 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<b>Timex</b>
				<p>
				Timex is one of the best brands when looking for a watch under the 100€ mark. Their selection of different types of time pieces spans from simplistic dress watches with next to no clutter on the dial to more complicated looking sports watches/chronographs. If you are looking to buy a fashion watch such as a MVMT or Daniel Wellington I would recommend you to check out timex. They make very similar designs to these fashion brands but come with a higher quality product and better prices.

				<b>Casio</b>
				<p>
				Casio is another great and affordable brand that has developed its own style over the years. Casio is most well known for creating very tough and reliable digital watches. Their selection spans from a lot of different price ranges with their most afforable models being sold for a few euros and their more expensive ones reaching into the thousands. Their G-shock models are some of the most popular watches on the market today, and for good reason. They are almost impossible to break.

				<b>Seiko</b>
				<p>
				Considered by most to be a very basic and boring brand. They have a reputation for making quartz watches but what a lot of people don't realise is that they make some of the best mechanical watches in their price bracket. Their new releases from the Presage line are a very good example of this. Most Presage watches come in for around or under 500€ and use the very reliable Seiko 4r36 automatic movement. This movement is and upgraded version of the classic 7s26 found in the more affordable Seiko 5 line (which I would also recommend). In general Seiko makes very robust and affordable pieces that I would recommend over any other brand.

				<b>Tissot</b>
				<p>
				Tissot is a very old Swiss brand founded back 1853. They are now owned by the Swatch Group and therefor make good use of ETA movements. Tissot makes a lot of different watches spanning from sports and dive watches to very traditional dress watches drawing inspiration from some of their most popular watches of the 20th century. This line is called the heritage line and is my favourite of the bunch.

				<hr>
				<b>Baltic</b>
				<p>
				Baltic is quite a new brand to the market that offers great quality for what you pay. Their most popular piece is the Bicompax chronograph for under 700€. What makes this watch so special is the fact that it is mechanical. This might not sound very special but the chronograph complication is in fact very difficult to make using a mechanical movement. Seeing something like this for under 1000€ is quite rare to say the least.

				<b>Hamilton</b>
				<p>
				Hamilton, like tissot is a very old brand now owned by the Swatch Group. They were originally located in the US but have since moved to Switzerland. You can actually see their American roots in some of their newer watches, like the Intra-matic. The Intra-matic is a very simplistic, almost bauhaus-style, dress watch using the famous ETA 2892-2 movement. This watch offers tremendous value considering that the 2892 is often found in much more expensive watches. <br>
				The Intra-matic is not the only watch they are famous for. Their most popular line of watches they produce is the Khaki-line. These are field watches that harkon back to WWII with many of its designs. They are very well known for being robust and reliable.

				<b>Junghans</b>
				<p>
				Junghans is another old brand founded all the way back in 1861 in Germany. The brand is still privately owned and located in Germany. At the start of the 20th century they were the largest watch and clock manufacturer in the world. Nowadays they are very well known for their minimalistic Bauhaus watches. A lot of people consider them to be the most authentic Bauhaus watches in the world since some of them were designed by Max Bill himself.

				<b>Frederique Constant</b>
				<p>
				Frederique Constant is a relatively new brand when compared to lets say Junghans. They were founded back in they 80s and are now a very popular brand. Unlike a lot of other newer brands, they are dedicated to traditional watchmaking and produce a lot of different types of watches with different complications. They have made moonphases, chronographs and even Tourbillons! Their most popular line of watches is their Slimline pieces. Theses are incredibly well made dress watches that look a lot more expensive than they really are.

				<hr>
				<b>Nomos</b>
				<p>
				Like Frederique Constant, Nomos is quite a new brand. Whilst Frederique Constant tries to be a bit more like Patek, Nomos leans more towards Junghans. This makes a lot of sence since Nomos is also a german brand. A lot of their watches, like the Orion, are bauhaus inspired. Just like Frederique Constant they make their own in-house calibers which is phenomenal to see in newer brands. They have really blown up recently with both their Orion and Tangente watches.

				<b>Omega</b>
				<p>
				Now that we are going into the flagship brands of the watch industry we have to mention Omega. Omega was founded in 1848 and have since then been one of the best brands on the market. In more recent times their Sea- and Speedmaster lines have been their most popular models, for good reason. The speedmaster was the first watch on the moon, which people love to remind you about. Any watch you choose from is Omega is a phenomenal choice.

				<b>Jaeger LeCoultre</b>
				<p>
				JLC is the oldest brand on this list, founded in 1833 in Switzerland. They have been one of the most innovative brands on the market, producing movements for other incredible brands such as Rolex. Nowadays they are most famous for their Reverso models and the Master collection. The Reverso is quite a unique piece with its rectangular case. The watch can also be lifted up and flipped around (dial down) to protect it. The Master collection consists of incredibly stylish dress watches and chronographs that draw inspiration from wathces of the mid 1900s.

				<b>Rolex</b>
				<p>
				If there is one brand on this list that everyone has heard of, it has to be Rolex. Rolex was founded in 1905 and has been one of the best selling brands since. Nowadays, unfortunately, they have gained a bit of a reputation for being used while "flexing". A lot of people buy them just to show off wealth instead of appreciating the craftsmanship behind them. Don't get me wrong here, Rolex makes incredibly good watches, but the reputation is for me a bit off putting.

				<b>A lange &amp; Söhne</b>
				<p>
				The last two brands are the two most expensive ones on this list. They are also, in my opinion, the best watches on the market. A Lange &amp; Söhne is and old Brand founded in 1845 in Glashütte, Germany. They are known for making flawless haute horology pieces, like the famous Datograph. 
				</p>
				<div class="textboximg">

				</div>
				<hr>
				<b>Patek Philippe</b>
				<p>
				Patek Phillipe is very similar to A Lange &amp; Söhne. The main differance is that A Lange use a very typical German design and Patek uses a very typcial Swiss one. Patek was founded only four years before A Lange so they are pretty much even there as well. If you are in the market for a true luxury watch, these two brands are you best choices.
